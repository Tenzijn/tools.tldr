    "description": "Fermion is an electron application that wraps frida-node and monaco-editor. It offers a fully integrated environment to prototype, test and refine Frida scripts through a single UI. With the integration of Monaco come all the features you would expect from Visual Studio Code: Linting, IntelliSense, keybindings, etc. In addition, Fermion has a TypeScript language definition for the Frida API so it is easy to write Frida scripts.",
