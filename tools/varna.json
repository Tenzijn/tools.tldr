    "description": "Varna is an AWS serverless cloud security tool that parses and alerts on CloudTrail logs using Event Query Language (EQL). Varna is deployed as a lambda function, for scanning and serving web requests, and a dynamodb table, for keeping track of seen alerts. Varna is cheap & efficient to run, costing less than 15 dollars a month with proper configuration and ingesting alerts as soon as CloudTrail stores them in S3.",
