    "description": "Marinus searches both public and internal resources to create a repository of the publicly exposed DNS records, TLS certificates and HTTP responses for a given organization. Marinus is a collection of Python scripts that will each search different resources such as Common Crawl, Certificate Transparency databases, Rapid7's Open Data project, and VirusTotal. It can also run tools such as zgrab to enumerate information about the identified hosts. The collected information is consolidated and stored in MongoDB. The optional NodeJS server provides a web view of the data and an API to allow your automation projects to access the data.",
